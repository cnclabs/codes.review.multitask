{"rating": 3.15, "description": "The story of a 14 year old girl named Sadie Hawthorne, a bright girl who is very interested in nature and the behaviors of animals. Reaching beyond the limits of studying animals, she attempts to analyze humans.", "spoiler_reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "content": "This film is based on a true story. The author of the novel bearing the same title, Einar M\u00e1r Gu\u00f0mundsson, had a brother, who turned mentally ill. I found this film very moving, following the main character's path down into illness, to see how he tries to cope with life after diagnosis, and how he makes friends at the mental institution, it all is very convincing. There are quite a few splendidly funny incidents also in the manuscript. The title of it gives nothing away concerning the story. You must watch it to understand ... and listen to the music, which is twisting and turning your heart and soul upside down and back as the film moves on. A must-see for everyone."}, {"rating": 5.0, "content": "This movie is great. Best acting i have ever seen in my life. Ingvar E Sigur\u00f0sson is the best Icelandic actor, and of course Hilmir Sn\u00e6r and Bjorn j\u00f6rundur. Great music and sound. Cold hard reality about a struggle of a man that has a lot of problems and the people in his life. Black humor mixed with great acting and this European art movies style, it works, it comes together in a the best Icelandic movie ever made. I say to you.\" See this film, you will not regret it\". I gave it 9 stars. If you see one Icelandic film in your life...See this one"}, {"rating": 4.0, "content": "This movie is stunningly free from storytelling. It's a pure experience where the music overshadow the visual impression. - Words cannot of course enough express what should be expressed, but it is the requirement of the chattering classes that chatter is put forward, entered into production lines of mediocrity and therefore a necessity in order to express any sensible thought or opinion about something which should not need to be degraded by chatter. Therefore these elaborate opinions are put forward to satisfy those empty minds which need to be filled by noise that you will not find however hard you try in this movie."}, {"rating": 5.0, "content": "If this film doesn't at least be selected for an oscar nominee for best foreign film I'm going to stop waking at nights watching the event. Fridrik Thor Fridriksson has proven that money isn't the key to making a good movie but originality. Out of a cold country comes a warm but thought-provoking film of a mentally ill man and his struggle against an insane world. After an insight like this, you question whether or not the man is crazy or the world he lives in."}, {"rating": 5.0, "content": "The movie Angels of the Universe is a pure masterpiece and it proves once again that you can make a brilliant movie on a low budget, e.g American Beauty and Blair Witch Project. The Director Fridrik Th\u00f3r Fridriksson gives the novel Englar alheimsins a new life on the white screen. The movie is a breakthrough in Icelandic film making because it's the biggest and the greatest movie that has been done in Iceland.<br /><br />The music in the film, played by Sigurr\u00f3s, is very symbolic for the film, it is absolutely brilliant. I recommend everybody who are able to think to go and see this film as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed. I would bet on this film to win the best foreign film award next year \u0096 all over the globe!"}, {"rating": 5.0, "content": "This film very succeed in the Film festival in Karlovy Vary, Czech rep. Logically. It' s based on a very good book, excellent actors, good camera, the best director and ICELANDIC. It was probably the most black comedy I've seen.<br /><br />I really DO recommend it to you."}, {"rating": 5.0, "content": "This film by Fri\u00f0rik \u00de\u00f3r, director of Children of Nature, is powerful. It has great music by Sigurr\u00f3s and good acting. It shows how sad insanity as a disease can be. There are many good jokes but the humor is dark. If that is not a problem then you should see this film. Note though this is not a comedy but a drama."}, {"rating": 4.5, "content": "Having a close experience with one such patient is probably the best reason why I had my heart rushing throughout the entire film. Intense, sensible, moral and revealing, and don't forget to check out the marvellous sound track. Really good."}, {"rating": 5.0, "content": "The movie is about Paul(P\u00e1ll) a young man who sinks into the harsh world of insanity and his stay at the mental hospital \"Kleppur\" and his friends. Victor(Viktor) who during his education in England started to think he was Adolf Hitler. Peter(P\u00e9tur) who took to much LSD and tried to fly of a roof top the fall left no broken bones or physical damage only insanity, he is obbsesed with China. Oli Beatle (\u00d3li B\u00edtill) Oli has spent most time at the hospital although Viktor is slightly older then him, he claims he wrote every single Beatles song and send it to them by telepathy<br /><br />The novel is better then the movie and covers all of Pauls life from birth to his death, there is a long time since I saw the movie but if I remember it right the movie doesn't cover Pauls childhood.<br /><br />\"Englar Alheimsins\" is funny,sad and powerful if you haven't seen it watch it NOW! and read the novel first it makes the movie better"}, {"rating": 4.5, "content": "This movie I've seen many times. I read the book , Englar Alheimsins which was written by Einar M\u00e1r Gu\u00f0mundsson who received the Scandinavian book awards for the work. The movie does not start on the same place as the book starts. It happens in Reykjav\u00edk and the main character, P\u00e1ll is young and having a good life with his girlfriend. But as she breaks up the relationship with him, he starts to get some headaches which make him annoyed and angry. And soon he starts to have big mental problems and then the movie begins. Soon he is puted in the Icelandic Mental Hospital called \"Kleppur\" and there you get to see some great characters like Viktor who thinks he is Hitler and \u00d3li who thinks that he writes all the \" The Beatles\" songs and sends them to them with mind transporting. Ingvar E Sigur\u00f0usson who has the role of the main character P\u00e1ll does is so work so well that it leaves you breathless. Also the music in this movie is mad by SIGURR\u00d3S and just for the music's cost you should see the movie. Overall a great movie meant to be seen."}, {"rating": 5.0, "content": "First at all: If you like watching movies I recommend you NOT to watch this one. Why? Afterwards you won't appreciate any other movie so easily anymore...<br /><br />Actually I don't wanna give rise to any excessive expectations but it is almost frightening how perfect, intense and beautiful this work of Einar Gudmundsson is. When in most movies there is at least one aspect spoiling the whole thing, like good actors but horrible dialogs or a nice scenery but low budget cinematography \u0096 in \u0084Angels of the Universe\" there is nothing of this ambivalence. Really everything is just great, even (and not least) the soundtrack with the magnificent Sigur R\u00f3s.<br /><br />In this story about Pall, a student that goes schizophrenic after being dumped by his girlfriend, especially the dialogs (and monologues) deserve some attention: together with (and sometimes in sharp contrast to) the plot they range from depressing and fatalistic to the whole opposite of comical and totally absurd. What is more, they are often (with quotes from Hegel and Shakespeare) of such a poetic beauty that the movie almost drifts into a surreal sphere and is only saved to the real world by its incredibly authentic actors.<br /><br />One of the other comments was already referring to another point: This movie is no trivial entertainment for relaxing in the evening. Despite of several comical reliefs in between it is largely disturbing, partly cynical and bitter, and most of all sad. It is a modern poetry about a life of insanity with all its emptiness, rage and solitude.<br /><br />Finally: When you've seen the movie \u0096 watch it again. There are some great visual metaphors and allusions in it that you realize only when you look twice and connect them with the \u0084moral of the story\". And of course: read the book, it contains a lot more of the small funny stories in between and also makes you understand some things in the movie a bit better."}]}
